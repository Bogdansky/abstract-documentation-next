# Project Instructions

This is a Next.js TypeScript application with the following structure:
- Uses App Router (Next.js 14+)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code linting

## Key conventions:
- All components should be typed with TypeScript
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Keep components in `src/app` directory
- Use server components by default, add "use client" only when needed
